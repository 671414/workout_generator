This is a school project for DAT158 Advanced algorithms and Machine Learning.
We have created a chatbot to generate strength and conditioning workouts based on ChatGPT-4o-mini. The project is hosted on Huggingface. The link to the chatbot is here https://huggingface.co/spaces/KasparER/workout_generator and you can find our dataset, which is being updated every time a workout is saved here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/KasparER/completed_workouts
